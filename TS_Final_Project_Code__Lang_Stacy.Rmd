# Data sources: 
* Hybrid Car sales: https://afdc.energy.gov/data/10301
* CO2 Emissions by Country: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC?view=map

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tswge)
library(dplyr)

car <- read.csv("../TimeSeries_Project/HybridCar.csv")

#Remove years that are majority blank
car <- car[40:60,]

#Rename column to something easier
names(car)[names(car) == "CO2.emissions..metric.tons.per.capita."] <- "CO2"
```

```{r}
plotts.wge(car$CO2)
plotts.wge(car$TotalSales)
